## Team Members: Ali Khan, Ammar Zia, Anas Ahmed, Humza Noor, and Taha Baig

### Introduction
Our goal in this project is to create a visualizer for pathfinding algorithms in real time through the browser. This will likely require no backend and run fully in JavaScript

### Current Roadmap
- [ ] Research which javascript framework to use
- 1. Pure JavaScript/TypeScript
- 2. Angular.JS
- 3. Vue.JS
- 4. Anime.JS
- [ ] Develop a working visual version of a graph
- - The best way to do this I am guessing is to create a 2D array and have each cell contain a node object with vertices to each adjacent node like a graph
- [ ] Develop pathfinding algos for graph
- [ ] Implement a UI to allow for picking a pathfinding algos and/or add obstacles to the graph
- [ ] Create explanation pages for each pathfinding algorithm
- [ ] Done?
