## Introduction

---
Our goal in this project is to create a visualizer for pathfinding algorithms in real time through the browser. This will likely require no backend and run fully in JavaScript

## Current Roadmap

---

- [ ] Research which javascript framework to use
- 1. Pure JavaScript/TypeScript
- 2. Angular.JS
- 3. Vue.JS
- [ ] Which animation Framework to use, if any
- 1. Anime.JS
- 2. pts.js
- 3. mo.js
- [ ] Develop a working visual version of a graph
  - The best way to do this I am guessing is to create a 2D array and have each cell contain a node object with vertices to each adjacent node like a graph
- [ ] Develop pathfinding algos for graph
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - BFS
  - DFS
  - a*
  - etc.
- [ ] Implement a UI to allow for picking a pathfinding algos and/or add obstacles to the graph
- [ ] Create explanation pages for each pathfinding algorithm
- [ ] Done?

## Stretch Goals

make it play doom lol
