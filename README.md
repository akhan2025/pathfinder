## Introduction

Our goal in this project is to create a visualizer for pathfinding algorithms in real time through the browser. This will likely require no backend and run fully in JavaScript

## Current Roadmap

- [X] Research which javascript framework to use
- 1. Pure JavaScript/TypeScript
- 2. Angular.JS
- 3. Vue.JS
- 4. React.JS âœ…
- [X] Create basic website to visualize testing
- [ ] Choosing a style for website and built it out 
- 1. Bootstrap
- 2. Bulma
- 3. Material UI
- 4. Grommet
- 5. Chakra UI
- [ ] Which animation Framework to use, if necessart
- 1. Anime.JS
- 2. pts.JS
- 3. mo.JS
- [X] Develop a working visual version of a graph
  - [X] Create Grid made out of cells
  - [X] Have each cell have its own state that can change
  - [X] Start and Target Nodes
- [ ] Develop pathfinding algos for graph
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - BFS
  - DFS
  - a*
  - etc.
- [ ] Implement a UI to allow for picking a pathfinding algos and/or add obstacles to the graph
- [ ] Done?

## Stretch Goals
- [ ] Create explanation pages for each pathfinding algorithm
- [ ] make it play doom lol
